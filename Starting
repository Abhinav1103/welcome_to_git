The main code will be in master.
One have to create branches (i.e not working on main code,but working on the copy of code) and push(commit the changes) after you feel your execution was correct.
Then one should raise pull request (asking master to make changes in sourcecode with code you have done).He/she will leave any comments if required and one should resolve.After that you would be able to merge branches and delete branch
